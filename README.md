## Description

The marketing company Horiseon would like for their webpage to be more accessible to users. I have refactored the company's existing code to ensure that it's webpage is inclusive and accessible to all types of users including those with disabilities and those using technical assistant programs. The updates for this code accessibility included semantic changes and reordering structure to the html index as well as the CSS styling code. Webpages that are accessible to users and follow semantic code structure are extremely important because it allows for order and flow of the application.

The following is a list of updates;

### HTML semantic updates

-Made webpage title company name instead of generic "website"
-Replaced div with header
-Replaced div with nav (html & CSS)
-Replaced div with img
-Replaced div with main & div with section
-Replaced div with aside & div with article
-Replaced div with footer
-Fixed nav anchor click jump to section "Search Engine Optimization" by adding ID to section

### HTML accessibility updates

Added alt descriptions for all images

### CSS functionality updates

-Replaced header div tags with nav html update
-Combined CSS styling tags for main & aside sections
-Deleted extra styling
